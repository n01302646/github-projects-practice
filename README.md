# Part 1

## Introduction
Use this document as a starting point for Part 1 of the Class 7 exercise.

As part of this exercise you will create a series of GitHub issues using the TODO items below. Items 1 and 2 describe updates that you will make and introduce into the mainline branch using pull requests. Item 3 can be completed directly through GitHub, meaning that no pull request is required. Don't forget to close the corresponding issues when the work is complete.

Please note that these TODO items represent the minimum requirements for the assignment. You are welcome to make _additional_ updates beyond what is described below.

## TODO
1. Update the 'index.html' file to include some information about yourself.
2. Update the 'styles.css' file to include a background and text color.
3. Publish the project to GitHub pages.
